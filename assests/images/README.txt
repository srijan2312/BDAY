PHOTO GALLERY INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Replace these placeholder images with your own photos
2. For best results, use photos that are:
   - Landscape orientation (horizontal)
   - Similar dimensions (recommended: 1200x800 pixels)
   - Properly compressed for web (JPG format recommended)
   - Named sequentially (photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, etc.)

3. For the gallery, aim for 8-12 high-quality photos

NOTE: The photos you place in this directory will automatically appear in the photo carousel.
